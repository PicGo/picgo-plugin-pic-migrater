## Configuration

Please configurate this plugin first!

After migrating, a new markdown file will be written in the same folder. So you should configurate this new file name's suffix first.

### CLI

```bash
picgo set plugin pic-migrater
```

### GUI

Open the setting page in the menu of the plugin.

For example, if your origin file named `2019.md` & if you set the `newFileSuffix` to `_new`, then after migrating, a new file named `2019_new.md` will be created.

#### include

If you set the `include` configuration then migrator will only migrate the files' path or url which match the `include`.

For example, if your set the `include` to `sinaimg.cn`， then migrator will only migrate the url or path includes `sinaimg.cn`.

#### exclude

If you set the `exclude` configuration then migrator will only migrate the files' path or url which don't match the `exclude`.

For example, if your set the `exclude` to `sinaimg.cn`， then migrator will only migrate the url or path doesn't includes `sinaimg.cn`.
